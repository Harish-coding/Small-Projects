# Small-Projects
A collection of program files, each dedicated to a small project

+ Be able to generate n number of passwords of length n, so the user can choose from them
+ Be able to specify, the length of password and the number of each type of character (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)


## Soring Algorithms

#### Description
ImplementedSorting algorithms in swift, and included summaries points on commonly used algorithms.

#### User Guide
Users can pull the sorting algorithms files, and edit the values in array assigned to `unsorted` variable, to test out how sorting algos behave with different arrays (when numbers are random, numbers are sorted in decending order and so on). For more details refer to the `README.md` file inside the `SortingAlgo` folder.

#### Scope for improvement
+ Implement a sorting visualiser, so new learners can visually see how the algos behave
+ Implement an user-friendly interface, so that users can input value into a text window, rather than having to open the file, change the values, and run it
